                <p> On the left side of the Home page logo is placed. While on the right side navigation bar is located. The viewer can easily know which page they are currently using by seeing the underline on the particular page. Text is written inside the box to make it readable on a colorful background. But it only applies to big-screen devices on small devices there is no such thing. The whole background image is used as a perspective which makes the background image stay in its fixed place. But on a mobile screen that is not the case.</p>

                   <p> From the iPad user's point of view about page looks like such same as other pages. All the text is in default font except the logo. Page only contains one moving image on big screen devices and a still image on a small device like the images given below.  On this page, the most eye-catching thing will be the image. And some small talk about myself and the upcoming project of <i>"Studio Ghibli"</i>.</p>

                       <p> From the phone user's point of view portfolio page look like such. This page only contains images. And all the images work from <i>Studio Ghibli.</i> You can see that the navigation bar which helps to access other pages such as Home, About, Portfolio, and such has disappeared. But in place of that three bar-like icons have appeared. Meaning a mobile user or any other small device user can easily access other pages through that "menu" icon. </p>

Name, Email, and Phone no. must not be blank. To contact us, the viewer can easily access the phone no available on the contact page. </p>
